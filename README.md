# ECOMZY - Simple Shopping Cart Project

Welcome to ECOMZY, a streamlined and user-friendly shopping cart application built with React.js, Redux, HTML, JavaScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS. This project is designed to provide a smooth online shopping experience with basic yet essential functionalities ideal for any e-commerce platform.

## Features

- **Dynamic Home and Cart Pages**: The application consists of two main pages:
  - **Home Page**: This page lists a variety of products across different categories. Each product features a brief description, its price, and an "Add to Cart" button that, once clicked, changes to "Remove Item" for easy management.
  - **Cart Page**: Displays all the products added to the cart, each with a "Delete" button to remove items individually. It also includes a cart summary displaying the total number of items and the total price. An empty cart will trigger a message "Your Cart is Empty" alongside a "Shop Now" button to navigate back to the Home page.

- **Responsive Navbar**: Includes a logo and navigation icons to switch seamlessly between the Home and Cart pages.

- **Toast Notifications**: Visual feedback through toast messages for actions like adding or removing items from the cart.
